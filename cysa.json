      "question": "Naomi wants to make her applications portable and easy to move to new environments without the overhead of a full operating system. What type of solution should she select?",
      "answer": [
        "An x86 architecture",
        "Virtualization",
        "Containerization",
        "A SASE solution"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Containerization",
      "explanation": "Naomi should containerize her application. This will provide her with a lightweight option that can be moved between services and environments without requiring her to have an OS included in her container. Virtualization would include a full operating system. SASE is a solution for edge-focused security, whereas x86 is a hardware architecture."

      "question": "Bharath wants to make changes to the Windows Registry. What tool should he select?",
      "answer": [
        "regwiz.msc",
        "notepad.exe",
        "secpol.msc",
        "regedit"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "regedit",
      "explanation": "The built-in Windows Registry editor is regedit. The secpol.msc tool is used to view and manage security policies. There is no regwiz tool, and Notepad, while handy, shouldn't be used to try to edit the Registry!"

    {
      "question": "Tom wants to set an appropriate logging level for his Cisco networking equipment while he's troubleshooting. What log level should he set?",
      "answer": [
        "1",
        "3",
        "5",
        "7"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "7",
      "explanation": "Tom knows that log level 7 provides debugging messages that he will need during troubleshooting. Once he's done, he'll likely want to set a lower log level to ensure that he doesn't create lots of noise in his logs."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following is not a common use of network segmentation?",
      "answer": [
        "Decreasing attack surfaces",
        "Limiting the scope of regulatory compliance",
        "Reducing availability",
        "Increasing the efficiency of a network"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Reducing availability",
      "explanation": "Segmentation is sometimes used to increase availability by reducing the potential impact of an attack or issue—intentionally reducing availability is unlikely to be a path chosen by most organizations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Ric's organization wants to implement zero trust. What concern should Ric raise about zero trust implementations?",
      "answer": [
        "They can be complex to implement.",
        "Zero trust does not support TLS inspection.",
        "Zero trust is not compatible with modern software-defined networks.",
        "They are likely to prevent users from accomplishing their jobs."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "They can be complex to implement.",
      "explanation": "Ric knows that zero trust can be complex to implement. Zero trust does not specifically prevent TLS inspection or conflict with SDN, and a successful zero trust implementation needs to validate user permissions but allow them to do their jobs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Michelle has a security token that her company issues to her. What type of authentication factor does she have?",
      "answer": [
        "Biometric",
        "Possession",
        "Knowledge",
        "Inherence"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Possession",
      "explanation": "Michelle's security token is an example of a possession factor, or “something you have.” A password or PIN would be a knowledge factor or “something you know,” and a fingerprint or retina scan would be a biometric, or inherence, factor."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which party in a federated identity service model makes assertions about identities to service providers?",
      "answer": [
        "RPs",
        "CDUs",
        "IDPs",
        "APs"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "IDPs",
      "explanation": "Identity providers (IDPs) make assertions about identities to relying parties and service providers in a federation. CDUs and APs are not terms used in federated identity designs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What design concept requires that each action requested be verified and validated before it is allowed to occur?",
      "answer": [
        "Secure access service edge",
        "Zero trust",
        "Trust but verify",
        "Extended validation network"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Zero trust",
      "explanation": "Zero trust requires each action or use of privileges to be validated and verified before it is allowed to occur. Secure access service edge combines software-defined networking with other security products and services to control edge device security rather than requiring a secured central service or network. Trust but verify and extended validation network are not design concepts."

    {
      "question": "Juan's organization uses LDAP to allow users to log into a variety of services without having to type in their username and password again. What type of service is in use?",
      "answer": [
        "SSO",
        "MFA",
        "EDR",
        "ZeroAuth"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "SSO",
      "explanation": "Juan's organization is using a single sign-on (SSO) solution that allows users to sign in once and use multiple services. MFA is multifactor authentication; EDR is endpoint detection and response, an endpoint security tool; and ZeroAuth was made up for this question."
    },
    {
      "question": "Jen's organization wants to ensure that administrator credentials are not used improperly. What type of solution should Jen recommend to address this requirement?",
      "answer": [
        "SAML",
        "CASB",
        "PAM",
        "PKI"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "PAM",
      "explanation": "A privilege access management (PAM) system would not only allow Jen's organization to manage and monitor privilege use for administrator accounts but would be helpful for other privileges as well. SAML is an XML-based language used to send authorization and authentication data, a CASB is a cloud access security broker used to manage cloud access rights, and PKI is a public key infrastructure used to issue and manage security certificates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Financial and medical records are an example of what type of data?",
      "answer": [
        "CHD",
        "PCI",
        "PII",
        "TS/SCI"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "PII",
      "explanation": "Common examples of PII include financial records, addresses and phone numbers, and national or state identification numbers like Social Security numbers, passport numbers, and driver's license numbers in the United States. CHD is cardholder data. PCI is the payment card industry, which defines the PCI DSS security standard. TS/SCI is a U.S. classification label standing for Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is not part of cardholder data for credit cards?",
      "answer": [
        "The cardholder's name",
        "The CVV code",
        "The expiration date",
        "The primary account number"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "The CVV code",
      "explanation": "The primary account number (PAN), the cardholder's name, and the expiration date of the card are considered cardholder data. Sensitive authentication data includes the CVV code, the contents of the magnetic stripe and chip, and the PIN code if one is used."
    },
    {
      "question": "Sally wants to find configuration files for a Windows system. Which of the following is not a common configuration file location?",
      "answer": [
        "The Windows Registry",
        "C:\\Program Files\\",
        "directory: \\Windows\\Temp",
        "C:\\ProgramData\\"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "directory: \\Windows\\Temp",
      "explanation": "The temporary files directory is not a common location for configuration files for programs. Instead, the Registry, ProgramData, and Program Data directories are commonly used to store configuration information."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of factor is a PIN?",
      "answer": [
        "A location factor",
        "A biometric factor",
        "A possession factor",
        "A knowledge factor"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A knowledge factor",
      "explanation": "A PIN is something you know and thus is a knowledge factor."
    },
    {
      "question": "What protocol is used to ensure that logs are time synchronized?",
      "answer": [
        "TTP",
        "NTP",
        "SAML",
        "FTP"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "NTP",
      "explanation": "NTP (Network Time Protocol) is the underlying protocol used to ensure that systems are using synchronized time."
    },
    {
      "question": "OAuth, OpenID, SAML, and AD FS are all examples of what type of technology?",
      "answer": [
        "Federation",
        "Multifactor authentication",
        "Identity vetting",
        "PKI"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Federation",
      "explanation": "OAuth, OpenID, SAML, and AD FS are all examples of technologies used for federated identity. They aren't MFA, identity vetting, or PKI technologies."
    },
    {
      "question": "Example Corporation has split their network into network zones that include sales, HR, research and development, and guest networks, each separated from the others using network security devices. What concept is Example Corporation using for their network security?",
      "answer": [
        "Segmentation",
        "Software-defined networking",
        "Single-point-of-failure avoidance",
        "Zoned routing"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Segmentation",
      "explanation": "Example Corporation is using segmentation, separating different risk or functional groupings. Software-defined networking is not mentioned, as no code-based changes or configurations are being made. There is nothing to indicate a single point of failure, and zoned routing was made up for this question—but the zone routing protocol is a network protocol used to maintain routes in a local network region."
    },
    {
      "question": "During a penetration test of Anna's company, the penetration testers were able to compromise the company's web servers and deleted their log files, preventing analysis of their attacks. What compensating control is best suited to prevent this issue in the future?",
      "answer": [
        "Using full-disk encryption",
        "Using log rotation",
        "Sending logs to a syslog server",
        "Using TLS to protect traffic"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Sending logs to a syslog server",
      "explanation": "Sending logs to a remote log server or bastion host is an appropriate compensating control. This ensures that copies of the logs exist in a secure location, allowing them to be reviewed if a similar compromise occurred. Full-disk encryption leaves files decrypted while in use and would not secure the log files from a compromise, whereas log rotation simply means that logs get changed out when they hit a specific size or time frame. TLS encryption for data (including logs) in transit can keep it private and prevent modification but wouldn't protect the logs from being deleted."
    },
    {
      "question": "Ben is preparing a system hardening procedure for his organization. Which of the following is not a typical system hardening process or step?",
      "answer": [
        "Updating and patching systems",
        "Enabling additional services",
        "Enabling logging",
        "Configuration disk encryption"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Enabling additional services",
      "explanation": "Ben knows that hardening processes typically focus on disabling unnecessary services, not enabling additional services. Updating, patching, enabling logging, and configuring security capabilities like disk encryption are all common hardening practices."
    },
    {
      "question": "Gabby is designing a multifactor authentication system for her company. She has decided to use a passphrase, a time-based code generator, and a PIN to provide additional security. How many distinct factors will she have implemented when she is done?",
      "answer": [
        "1",
        "2",
        "3",
        "4"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "2",
      "explanation": "While it may seem like Gabby has implemented three different factors, both a PIN and a passphrase are knowledge-based factors and cannot be considered distinct factors. She has implemented two distinct factors with her design. If she wanted to add a third factor, she could replace either the password or the PIN with a fingerprint scan or other biometric factor."

    {
      "question": "What Windows tool provides detailed information, including information about USB host controllers, memory usage, and disk transfers?",
      "answer": ["Statmon", "Resmon", "Perfmon", "Winmon"],
      "correct_answer": "Perfmon",
      "explanation": "C. Perfmon, or Performance Monitor, provides the ability to gather detailed usage statistics for many items in Windows. Resmon, or Resource Monitor, monitors CPU, memory, and disk usage but does not provide information about things like USB host controllers and other detailed instrumentation. Statmon and winmon are not Windows built-in tools."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of network information should you capture to be able to provide a report about how much traffic systems in your network sent to remote systems?",
      "answer": ["Syslog data", "WMI data", "Resmon data", "Flow data"],
      "correct_answer": "Flow data",
      "explanation": "D. Flow data provides information about the source and destination IP address, protocol, and total data sent and would provide the detail needed. Syslog, WMI, and resmon data are all system log information and would not provide this information."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following technologies is best suited to prevent wired rogue devices from connecting to a network?",
      "answer": ["NAC", "PRTG", "Port security", "NTP"],
      "correct_answer": "NAC",
      "explanation": "A. Network access control (NAC) can be set up to require authentication. Port security is limited to recognizing MAC addresses, making it less suited to preventing rogue devices. PRTG is a monitoring tool, and NTP is the Network Time Protocol."
    },
    {
      "question": "As part of her job, Danielle sets an alarm to notify her team via email if her Windows server uses 80 percent of its memory and to send a text message if it reaches 90 percent utilization. What is this setting called?",
      "answer": ["A monitoring threshold", "A preset notification level", "Page monitoring", "Perfmon calibration"],
      "correct_answer": "A monitoring threshold",
      "explanation": "A. A monitoring threshold is set to determine when an alarm or report action is taken. Thresholds are often set to specific values or percentages of capacity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Chris is reviewing a file that is part of an exploit package. He notes that there is a file that has content with curly brackets ({}) around statements. What file type from the following list is he most likely reviewing?",
      "answer": ["Plain text", "JSON", "XML", "HTML"],
      "correct_answer": "JSON",
      "explanation": "B. Chris is most likely reviewing a JSON file. HTML and XML typically use angle brackets (< and >) rather than curly brackets. Plain text does not use or require either."
    },
    {
      "question": "What term describes a system sending heartbeat traffic to a botnet command-and-control server?",
      "answer": ["Beaconing", "Zombie ping", "CNCstatus", "CNClog"],
      "correct_answer": "Beaconing",
      "explanation": "A. Beaconing activity (sometimes called heartbeat traffic) occurs when traffic is sent to a botnet command-and-control system. The other terms are made up."
    },
    {
      "question": "Cameron wants to check if a file matches a known-good original. What technique can he use to do so?",
      "answer": [
        "Decrypt both the file and the original to compare them.",
        "Use strings to compare the file content.",
        "Hash both the file and the original and compare the hashes.",
        "Check the file size and creation date."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Hash both the file and the original and compare the hashes.",
      "explanation": "C. Cameron should compare the hashes of the known-good original and the new file to see if they match. The files are not described as encrypted, so decrypting them won't help. Strings can show text in binary files but won't compare the files. File size and creation date are not guarantees of a file being the same."
    },
    {
      "question": "What can the MAC address of a rogue device tell you?",
      "answer": ["Its operating system version", "The TTL of the device", "What type of rogue it is", "The manufacturer of the device"],
      "correct_answer": "The manufacturer of the device",
      "explanation": "D. Hardware vendor ID codes are part of MAC addresses and can be checked for devices that have not had their MAC address changed. It is possible to change MAC addresses, so relying on only the MAC address is not recommended, but it can be useful to help identify what a rogue device might be."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can Jim most effectively locate a wireless rogue access point that is causing complaints from employees in his building?",
      "answer": ["Nmap", "Signal strength and triangulation", "Connecting to the rogue AP", "NAC"],
      "correct_answer": "Signal strength and triangulation",
      "explanation": "B. Locating a rogue AP is often best done by performing a physical survey and triangulating the likely location of the device by checking its signal strength. If the AP is plugged into the organization's network, nmap may be able to find it, but connecting to it is unlikely to provide its location (or be safe!). NAC would help prevent the rogue device from connecting to an organizational network but won't help locate it."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following tools does not provide real-time drive capacity monitoring for Windows?",
      "answer": ["Microsoft Configuration Manager", "Resmon", "SCOM", "Perfmon"],
      "correct_answer": "Microsoft Configuration Manager",
      "explanation": "A. Microsoft Configuration Manager provides non-real-time reporting for disk space. Resmon, perfmon, and SCOM can all provide real-time reporting, which can help identify problems before they take a system down."
    },
    {
      "question": "One of the business managers in Geeta's organization reports that she received an email with a link that appeared to be a link to the organization's HR website, and that the website it went to when she clicked on it was very similar to the organization's website. Fortunately, the manager noticed that the URL was different than usual. What technique best describes a link that is disguised to appear legitimate?",
      "answer": ["An obfuscated link", "A symbolic link", "A phishing link", "A decoy link"],
      "correct_answer": "An obfuscated link",
      "explanation": "A. Obfuscated links take advantage of tricks, including using alternate encodings, typos, and long URLs that contain legitimate links wrapped in longer malicious links. Symbolic links are a pointer used by Linux operating systems to point to an actual file using a filename and link. Phishing links and decoy links are not common terms."
    },
    {
      "question": "Angela wants to review the syslog on a Linux system. What directory should she check to find it on most Linux distributions?",
      "answer": ["/home/log", "/var/log", "/log", "/var/syslog"],
      "correct_answer": "/var/log",
      "explanation": "B. The syslog file is found in /var/log on most Linux hosts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Laura wants to review headers in an email that one of her staff is suspicious of. What should she not have that person do if she wants to preserve the headers?",
      "answer": [
        "She shouldn't have them print the email.",
        "She shouldn't have them reply to the email.",
        "She shouldn't have them forward the email to her.",
        "She shouldn't have them download the email."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "She shouldn't have them forward the email to her.",
      "explanation": "C. Forwarding an email will remove the headers and replace them with new headers on the forwarded email—but not the original. Laura should use a “view headers” or “view original email” option if it exists to view and analyze the headers. Printing, replying, or downloading an email will not impact the headers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a key differentiator between a SIEM and a SOAR?",
      "answer": [
        "A SIEM does not provide a dashboard.",
        "A SOAR provides automated response capabilities.",
        "A SOAR does not provide log aggregation.",
        "A SIEM provides log analysis."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A SOAR provides automated response capabilities.",
      "explanation": "B. SOAR tools focus on orchestration and response. SIEM tools typically do not focus on automated response. Both leverage log analysis and aggregation and will provide dashboards and reporting."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following options is not a valid way to check the status of a service in Windows?",
      "answer": [
        "Use sc at the command line.",
        "Use service ––status at the command line.",
        "Use services.msc.",
        "Query service status using PowerShell."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Use service ––status at the command line.",
      "explanation": "B. The service --status command is a Linux command. Windows service status can be queried using sc, the Services snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), or via a PowerShell query."

      "question": "Avik has been asked to identify unexpected traffic on her organization's network. Which of the following is not a technique she should use?",
      "answer": ["Protocol analysis", "Heuristics", "Baselining", "Beaconing"],
      "correct_answer": "Beaconing",
      "explanation": "D. Protocol analysis, using heuristic (behavior)-based detection capabilities, and building a network traffic baseline are all common techniques used to identify unexpected network traffic. Beaconing occurs when a system contacts a botnet command-and-control (C&C) system, and it is likely to be a source of unexpected traffic."
    },
    {
      "question": "Sofia suspects that a system in her datacenter may be sending beaconing traffic to a remote system. Which of the following is not a useful tool to help verify her suspicions?",
      "answer": ["Flows", "A protocol analyzer", "SNMP", "An IDS or IPS"],
      "correct_answer": "SNMP",
      "explanation": "C. SNMP will not typically provide specific information about a system's network traffic that would allow you to identify outbound connections. Flows, sniffers (protocol analyzers), and an IDS or IPS can all provide a view that would allow the suspect traffic to be captured."

    {
      "question": "Susan wants to use an email security protocol to determine the authenticity of an email. Which of the following options will ensure that her organization's email server can determine if it should accept email from a sender?",
      "answer": ["DMARC", "SPF", "DKIM", "POP3"],
      "correct_answer": "DMARC",
      "explanation": "A. DMARC (Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) is a protocol that combines SPF and DKIM to prove that a sender is who they claim to be. DKIM validates that a domain is associated with a message, whereas SPF lists the servers that are authorized to send from your domain. POP3 is an email protocol but does not perform the function described."

      "question": "Juan wants to see a list of processes along with their CPU utilization in an interactive format. What built-in Linux tool should he use?",
      "answer": ["df", "top", "tail", "cpugrep"],
      "correct_answer": "top",
      "explanation": "B. The top command in Linux provides an interactive interface to view CPU utilization, memory usage, and other details for running processes. df shows disk usage, tail displays the end of a file, and cpugrep is a made-up command."

      "question": "Nandita has encountered an attacker who appears to be using a commonly available exploit package to attack her organization. The package seems to have been run with default configurations against her entire public-facing Internet presence from a single system. What type of threat actor is she most likely facing?",
      "answer": ["An APT", "A hacktivist", "A script kiddie", "A nation-state actor"],
      "correct_answer": "A script kiddie",
      "explanation": "C. The lack of complexity and nuance most likely indicates that she has discovered an attack by an unskilled attacker, sometimes called a “script kiddie”."

      "answer": ["Review of security breaches or compromises your organization has faced", "Review of current vulnerability scans", "Review of current data handling standards", "Review of threat intelligence feeds for new threats"],
      "correct_answer": "Review of security breaches or compromises your organization has faced",
      "explanation": "A. Understanding what your organization needs is important for the requirements gathering phase of the intelligence cycle. Reviewing recent breaches and compromises can help to define what threats you are currently facing. Current vulnerability scans can identify where you may be vulnerable but are less useful for threat identification. Data handling standards do not provide threat information, and intelligence feed reviews list new threats, but those are useful only if you know what type of threats you're likely to face so that you can determine which ones you should target."

      "answer": ["His organization's attack surface", "A possible attack vector", "An example of adversary capability", "A probability assessment"],
      "correct_answer": "A possible attack vector",
      "explanation": "B. Attack vectors, or the means by which an attacker can gain access to their target, can include things like USB key drops. You may be tempted to answer this question with adversary capability, but remember the definition: the resources, intent, or ability of the likely threat actor. Capability here doesn't mean what they can do but their ability to do so. The attack surface might include the organization's parking lot in this example, but this is not an example of an attack surface, and there was no probability assessment included in this problem."

      "answer": ["Behavioral", "Instinctual", "Habitual", "IOCs"],
      "correct_answer": "Behavioral",
      "explanation": "A. Behavioral assessments are very useful when you are attempting to identify insider threats. Since insider threats are often hard to distinguish from normal behavior context of the actions performed, such as after-hours logins, misuse of credentials, and logins from abnormal locations or in abnormal patterns, other behavioral indicators are often used."

      "answer": ["Social media", "Blogs", "Government bulletins", "The dark web"],
      "correct_answer": "The dark web",
      "explanation": "D. Threat actors like criminal organizations frequently operate via the dark web. Forums operate as clearinghouses for information, resources, and access via TOR-hosted sites. While social media, blogs, or government bulletins may provide information about a criminal organization, more likely to publish information themselves on the dark web."

      "correct_answer": "Administrative account logins",
      "explanation": "A. Administrative logins themselves are not IOCs, but unexpected behavior associated with them or other atypical behavior is an indicator of compromise. Unexpected modifications of configuration files, login activity from atypical countries or locations, and large file transfers from administrative systems are all common indicators of compromise."

      "answer": ["A firewall", "A honeypot", "A web application firewall", "A SIEM"],
      "correct_answer": "A honeypot",
      "explanation": "B. Nick should deploy a honeypot to capture attack tools and techniques for further analysis. Firewalls block traffic. A web application firewall is a firewall designed to protect web applications, and while it may capture useful information it is not as well suited to this purpose. A SIEM, or security information and event management tool, may also capture relevant attack data but it's not specifically designed for the purpose like a honeypot is."

      "correct_answer": "As part of vulnerability feeds for scanning systems",
      "explanation": "B. Threat intelligence feeds often provide information about what vulnerabilities are being actively exploited as well as about new exploits. This can influence patching priorities and vulnerability management efforts. Zero-day threats aren't known until they are released. Vulnerability management efforts help to determine what patches aren't installed, but threat intelligence doesn't determine that. Threat intelligence isn't directly leveraged for quantitative risk assessment as part of vulnerability management efforts in typical organizations."

      "answer": ["smb_login", "Angry IP", "nmap", "wmap"],
      "correct_answer": "wmap",
      "explanation": "D. The wmap scanner is a web application scanner module for the Metasploit Framework that can scan for vulnerable web applications. The smb_login tool looks for SMB shares, not web applications. Angry IP Scanner is not integrated with Metasploit, and nmap is a port scanner, not a full web application vulnerability scanner."

      "answer": ["–os", "–id", "–O", "–osscan"],
      "correct_answer": "–O",
      "explanation": "C. Nmap's operating system identification flag is –O and it enables OS detection. –A also enables OS identification and other features. –osscan with modifiers like –limit and –guess set specific OS identification features. –os and –id are not nmap flags."

      "answer": ["Angry IP Scanner", "wmap", "Zenmap", "nmap-gs"],
      "correct_answer": "Zenmap",
      "explanation": "C. Zenmap is a graphical user interface for nmap that also supports graphical output, including visual maps of networks. Valerie can use Zenmap to control nmap and create the output she wants. Angry IP Scanner is a separate scanner and does not generate a visual map of networks—instead, it provides lists. Wmap is a plug-in for the Metasploit Framework and a stand-alone tool that is a web application and service vulnerability testing tool, and nmap-gs was made up for this question."

      "answer": ["IP addresses", "Hostnames", "Time to live", "Port numbers"],
      "correct_answer": "IP addresses",
      "explanation": "C. The time to live (TTL) provided as part of responses is used to evaluate the number of hops in a network, and thus to derive a best guess at network topology. While IP addresses can sometimes be related to network topology, they're less likely to be directly associated with it. Hostnames and port numbers have no correlation to topology."

      "answer": ["-sn", "-PS", "-Pn", "-sL"],
      "correct_answer": "-Pn",

      "correct_answer": "Maltego",
      "explanation": "B. Hue knows that Maltego provides transforms that can identify hosts and IP addresses related to a domain and that it can then gather additional information using other OSINT transforms. Nmap and Angry IP Scanner are both active scanning tools, and traceroute won't provide useful footprinting information given just a domain name."

      "correct_answer": "OS detection",
      "explanation": "D. Operating system detection often uses TCP options support, IP ID sampling, and window size checks, as well as other indicators that create unique fingerprints for various operating systems. Service identification often leverages banners since TCP capabilities are not unique to a given service. Fuzzing is a code testing method, and application scanning is usually related to web application security."

      "explanation": "A. Recon-ng is not a vulnerability scanner. It does help with OSINT activities like looking for sensitive files, conducting OSINT information gathering, and finding target IP addresses. Li knows that Recong-ng is an OSINT-focused tool and that vulnerability scanning is an active, rather than passive, information-gathering effort.

      "correct_answer": "Nmap",
      "explanation": "D. Nmap support is built into MSF, allowing easy port scanning by simply calling nmap as you would normally from the command line. Angry IP Scanner is not built in, and both Recon-ng and Maltego are separate tools with OSINT and information management capabilities."

      "correct_answer": "TCP OS header",
      "explanation": "C. Operating system fingerprinting relies in many cases on knowing what the TCP stack for a given operating system does when it sends responses. You can read more detail about the many ways nmap tests for and filters the data at https://nmap.org/book/osdetect-methods.html#osdetect-probes.

      "correct_answer": "Firewalls can prevent port scanners from detecting systems.",
      "explanation": "C. Firewalls can prevent responses to port scanners, making systems essentially invisible to the scanner. A port scanner alone is not sufficient for asset discovery in many networks. Port scanners often have some limited vulnerability detection built in, often relying on version information or fingerprinting, but not detecting vulnerabilities does not prevent discovery. Port scanners make a best guess at services on a port based on information provided by the service. Port scanners do not typically cause problems for most modern applications and services but can under some circumstances. This shouldn't stop a discovery port scan, though!"

      "question": "What type of assessment is particularly useful for identifying insider threats?",
      "answer": ["Behavioral", "Instinctual", "Habitual", "IOCs"],
      "correct_answer": "Behavioral",
      "explanation": "A. Behavioral assessments are very useful when you are attempting to identify insider threats. Since insider threats are often hard to distinguish from normal behavior, context of the actions performed, such as afterhours logins, misuse of credentials, logins from abnormal locations or in abnormal patterns, and other behavioral indicators, are often used."

      "answer": ["Static analysis", "Dynamic analysis", "Compilation", "Decompilation"],
      "correct_answer": "Dynamic analysis",
      "explanation": "B. Dynamic analysis techniques actually execute the code during the testing process. Static code analysis tools and techniques analyze the structure and content of code without executing the code itself. Compilation is the process of transforming source code into an executable and decompilation attempts to reverse that process. Neither compilation nor decompilation executes the code."

      "answer": ["Regression testing", "Unit testing", "Stress testing", "Fagan testing"],
      "correct_answer": "Stress testing",
      "explanation": "C. Tiffany is stress-testing the application. Stress testing intentionally goes beyond the application's normal limits to see how it responds to extreme loads or other abnormal conditions beyond its normal capacity. Unit testing tests individual components of an applications, while regression testing is done to ensure that new versions don't introduce old bugs. Fagan testing is a formal method of code inspection."

      "answer": ["User accesses a secure file", "Administrator changes a file's permission settings", "Intruder breaks into a building", "Former employee crashes a server"],
      "correct_answer": "Former employee crashes a server",
      "explanation": "D. A former employee crashing a server is an example of a computer security incident because it is an actual violation of the availability of that system. A user accessing a secure file and an administrator changing file permission settings are examples of security events but are not security incidents.\n\nAn intruder breaking into a building may be a security event, but it is not necessarily a computer security event unless they perform some action affecting a computer system."

      "question": "Ben is working to classify the functional impact of an incident. The incident has disabled email service for approximately 30 percent of his organization's staff. How should Ben classify the functional impact of this incident according to the NIST scale?",
      "answer": ["None", "Low", "Medium", "High"],
      "correct_answer": "Medium",
      "explanation": "C. The definition of a medium functional impact is that the organization has lost the ability to provide a critical service to a subset of system users. That accurately describes the situation that Ben finds himself in. Assigning a low functional impact is only done when the organization can provide all critical services to all users at diminished efficiency. Assigning a high functional impact is only done if a critical service is not available to all users."

      "question": "What phase of the Cyber Kill Chain includes creation of persistent backdoor access for attackers?",
      "answer": ["Delivery", "Exploitation", "Installation", "C2"],
      "correct_answer": "Installation",
      "explanation": "C. The installation phase of the Cyber Kill Chain focuses on providing persistent backdoor access for attackers. Delivery occurs when the tool is put into action either directly or indirectly, whereas exploitation occurs when a vulnerability is exploited. Command-and-Control (C2) uses two-way communications to provide continued remote control."

      "question": "Susan needs to track evidence that has been obtained throughout its life cycle. What documentation does she need to create and maintain if she expects the evidence to be used in a legal case?",
      "answer": ["Forensic hashes", "Legal hold", "Chain of custody", "IoC ratings"],
      "correct_answer": "Chain of custody",
      "explanation": "C. Susan needs to track the chain of custody for the evidence and should ensure that a proper chain of custody is maintained. This is especially important when dealing with data that may become part of legal proceedings. Forensic hashes are typically generated as part of forensic processes to ensure that the original and copies of forensic data match, but a hash alone does not provide chain-of-custody tracking. Legal holds require organizations to preserve data but don't track chain of custody, and IoC ratings are unrelated to this question."

      "correct_answer": "Compare a hash of the original drive to the drive image.",
      "explanation": "A. Hashes are used to validate drive images and other forensic artifacts. Comparing a hash of the original and the image is commonly used to ensure that they match. None of the other options will validate a drive image, and encrypting a drive will modify it, spoiling the evidence."

      "answer": ["Heuristics", "Baselines", "Protocol analysis", "Network flow logs"],
      "correct_answer": "Baselines",
      "explanation": "B. A baseline for traffic patterns and levels would allow Kathleen to determine if the traffic was typical or if something unusual was going on. Heuristics focus on behaviors, and Kathleen wants to see if traffic levels are different, not behaviors. Protocol analysis looks at whether there is an unusual protocol or data, and network flow logs are useful for determining which systems are sending traffic to where and via what protocol."

      "correct_answer": "The quality of the feed",
      "explanation": "B. Open feed data can vary in quality and reliability. That means Renee will have to put processes in place to assess the quality and reliability of the IoC information she is receiving. An open feed implies that it is free. Open feeds are generally active, and IoC detail levels vary as IoCs are created and updated, regardless of the type of feed."

      "answer": ["Collecting NetFlow data", "Using a protocol analyzer", "Pinging remote systems", "Enabling SNMP"],
      "correct_answer": "Pinging remote systems",
      "explanation": "C. Active monitoring is focused on reaching out to gather data using tools like ping and iPerf. Passive monitoring using protocol analyzers collects network traffic and router-based monitoring using SNMP, and flows gather data by receiving or collecting logged information."

      "answer": ["He should review the system log.", "He should check the Task Scheduler.", "He should check cron jobs.", "He should check user directories."],
      "correct_answer": "He should check cron jobs.",
      "explanation": "C. While there could be other issues, a recurring scheduled task is most likely to be set as a cron job, and Sameer should start his search there. The Task Scheduler is a Windows tool, system logs may or may not contain information about the process, and searching user directories would not provide indications of what process was starting at a given time."

      "correct_answer": "Review the alert to determine why it occurred",
      "explanation": "B. Reviewing why the alert occurred is Jim's first step. IoCs in isolation may not indicate a compromise or attack, so validating the alert is an important first step. Shutting down a system due to an alert could cause an outage or prevent forensic investigation. There is nothing in question to indicate that this is a network-based attack that will have been logged, and port scans are also not indicated by the question."

He checks the source addresses for inbound traffic and finds that the traffic is coming from many different systems all over the world. What should Mark identify this as if he believes that it may be an attack?",
      "answer": ["A denial-of-service attack", "A distributed network scan", "A DNS-based attack", "A distributed denial-of-service attack"],
      "correct_answer": "A distributed denial-of-service attack",
      "explanation": "D. The behavior described with a significant increase in traffic from many systems all over the world is most likely a distributed denial-of-service attack if it is malicious. Mark's challenge will be in determining if it is an attack or if some other event has occurred that is driving traffic to his website—a post that goes viral can be difficult to differentiate from an attack in some cases!"

      "correct_answer": "Authentication logs and user creation logs",
      "explanation": "A. Valentine knows that unauthorized access often involves the creation of unauthorized user accounts and authentication events that allowed access to the system. System logs contain system events, but not authentication or user creation information. Application logs track application events and also typically won't show this type of information."

      "answer": ["A user who forgot their password", "A broken application", "A brute-force attack", "A misconfigured service"],
      "correct_answer": "A brute-force attack",
      "explanation": "C. A series of attempted logins from the remote system with the same username but different passwords is a common indicator of a brute-force attack. While more sophisticated attackers will use multiple remote systems and will spread attempts over time, a simple brute-force attack will appear exactly like this. Sayed can verify this by checking in with the administrator whose username is being used."

      "correct_answer": "The monitored link failed.",
      "explanation": "C. The most likely answer is that the link has failed. Incorrectly set sampling rates will not provide a good view of traffic, and a DDoS attack is more likely to show large amounts of traffic. SNMP is a monitoring tool and would not result in flow data changing."

      "answer": ["Bot-like behavior", "Port scanning", "Denial of service", "Escalation of privileges"],
      "correct_answer": "Bot-like behavior",
      "explanation": "A. Actions performed more quickly than a typical user would perform them can be an indicator of bot-like behavior. If the user performing the actions does not typically run scripts or connect to multiple machines, Greg may want to investigate more deeply, including checking logs on the remote systems to see what authentication was attempted. SSH connections alone are not indicators of port scanning, escalation of privilege, or denial-of-service attacks."

      "answer": ["Increases in cached hits to the database", "Decreases in network traffic to the database", "Increases in disk reads for the database", "Decreases in database size"],
      "correct_answer": "Increases in disk reads for the database",
      "explanation": "C. An attacker is likely to attempt to gather information from the entire database, meaning that cached hits will not make up the full volume of queries. Thus, disk reads from a database may be a more important indicator of compromise than an increase in cached hits that may simply be more typical usage."

      "answer": ["Check the filesystem logs.", "Check the security logs.", "Search for large files and directories.", "Search for file changes."],
      "correct_answer": "Search for large files and directories.",
      "explanation": "C. The first step in Alex's process should be to identify where the files that are filling the drive are located and what they are. A simple search can help with this by sorting by large directories and files. Windows does not have a filesystem log that would record this, and security logs are focused on security events, not filesystem information. Searching for files that have changed requires a tool that tracks changes, which is not part of a default Windows installation."

      "question": "Alice is responding to a cybersecurity incident and notices a system that she suspects is compromised. She places this system on a quarantine VLAN with limited access to other networked systems. What containment strategy is Alice pursuing?",
      "answer": ["Eradication", "Isolation", "Segmentation", "Removal"],
      "correct_answer": "Segmentation",
      "explanation": "C. In a segmentation approach, the suspect system is placed on a separate network where it has very limited access to other networked resources."
    },
    {
      "question": "Alice confers with other team members and decides that even allowing limited access to other systems is an unacceptable risk and chooses instead to prevent the quarantine VLAN from accessing any other systems by putting firewall rules in place that limit access to other enterprise systems. The attacker can still control the system to allow Alice to continue monitoring the incident. What strategy is she now pursuing?",
      "answer": ["Eradication", "Isolation", "Segmentation", "Removal"],
      "correct_answer": "Isolation",
      "explanation": "B. In the isolation strategy, the quarantine network is directly connected to the Internet or restricted severely by firewall rules so that the attacker may continue to control it but not gain access to any other networked resources."
    },
    {
      "question": "After observing the attacker, Alice decides to remove the Internet connection entirely, leaving the systems running but inaccessible from outside the quarantine VLAN. What strategy is she now pursuing?",
      "answer": ["Eradication", "Isolation", "Segmentation", "Removal"],
      "correct_answer": "Removal",
      "explanation": "D. In the removal approach, Alice keeps the systems running for forensic purposes but completely cuts off their access to or from other networks, including the Internet."

      "answer": ["Identifying the source of the attack", "Eradication", "Containment", "Recovery"],
      "correct_answer": "Containment",
      "explanation": "C. Tamara's first priority should be containing the attack. This will prevent it from spreading to other systems and also potentially stop the exfiltration of sensitive information. Only after containing the attack should Tamara move on to eradication and recovery activities. Identifying the source of the attack should be a low priority."

      "answer": ["IOCs", "Scope", "Impact", "Reimaging"],
      "correct_answer": "IOCs",
      "explanation": "A. During an incident investigation, the team may encounter new indicators of compromise (IOCs) based on the tools, techniques, and tactics used by attackers. As part of the lessons learned review, the team should clearly identify any new IOCs and make recommendations for updating the organization's security monitoring program to include those IOCs. This will reduce the likelihood of a similar incident escaping attention in the future. Scope, impact, and reimaging should be considered during containment, eradication, and recovery."

      "answer": ["Identity of the attacker", "Time of the attack", "Root cause of the attack", "Attacks on other organizations"],
      "correct_answer": "Root cause of the attack",
      "explanation": "C. Understanding the root cause of an attack is critical to the incident recovery effort. Analysts should examine all available information to help reconstruct the attacker's actions. This information is crucial to remediating security controls and preventing future similar attacks."

      "answer": ["Containment", "Recovery", "Post-Incident Activities", "Eradication"],
      "correct_answer": "Eradication",
      "explanation": "D. The primary purpose of eradication is to remove any of the artifacts of the incident that may remain on the organization's network. This may include the removal of any malicious code from the network, the sanitization of compromised media, and the securing of compromised user accounts."

      "question": "Which one of the following is not a common use of formal incident reports?",
      "answer": ["Training new team members", "Sharing with other organizations", "Developing new security controls", "Assisting with legal action"],
      "correct_answer": "Developing new security controls",
      "explanation": "B. There are many potential uses for written incident reports. First, it creates an institutional memory of the incident that is useful when developing new security controls and training new security team members. Second, it may serve as an important record of the incident if there is ever legal action that results from the incident. These reports should be classified and not disclosed to external parties."

      "question": "Which one of the following data elements would not normally be included in an evidence log?",
      "answer": ["Serial number", "Record of handling", "Storage location", "Malware signatures"],
      "correct_answer": "Malware signatures",
      "explanation": "D. Malware signatures would not normally be included in an evidence log. The log would typically contain identifying information (e.g., the location, serial number, model number, hostname, MAC addresses and IP addresses of a computer), the name, title and phone number of each individual who collected or handled the evidence during the investigation, the time and date (including time zone) of each occurrence of evidence handling, and the locations where the evidence was stored."

      "question": "Sondra determines that an attacker has gained access to a server containing critical business files and wishes to ensure that the attacker cannot delete those files. Which one of the following strategies would meet Sondra's goal?",
      "answer": ["Isolation", "Segmentation", "Removal", "None of the above"],
      "correct_answer": "None of the above",
      "explanation": "D. Even removing a system from the network doesn't guarantee that the attack will not continue. In the example given in this chapter, an attacker can run a script on the server that detects when it has been removed from the network and then proceeds to destroy data stored on the server."

He does not need to reuse the drive but wants to return it to its owner, an outside contractor. What is the appropriate disposition?",
      "answer": ["Destroy", "Clear", "Erase", "Purge"],
      "correct_answer": "Destroy",
      "explanation": "A. The data disposition flowchart in Figure 11.7 directs that any media containing highly sensitive information that will leave the control of the organization must be destroyed. Joe should purchase a new replacement device to provide to the contractor."

    {
      "question": "Which one of the following is not typically found in a cybersecurity incident report?",
      "answer": ["Chronology of events", "Identity of the attacker", "Estimates of impact", "Documentation of lessons learned"],
      "correct_answer": "Identity of the attacker",
      "explanation": "B. Incident reports should include a chronology of events, estimates of the impact, and documentation of lessons learned, in addition to other information. Incident response efforts should not normally focus on uncovering the identity of the attacker, so this information would not be found in an incident report."

      "answer": ["Removal", "Isolation", "Detection", "Segmentation"],
      "correct_answer": "Removal",
      "explanation": "A. Only removal of the compromised system from the network will stop the attack against other systems. Isolated and/or segmented systems are still permitted access to the Internet and could continue their attack. Detection is a purely passive activity that does not disrupt the attacker at all."

        "Audit and compliance stakeholders",
        "System administration stakeholders",
        "Management stakeholders"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Security operations and oversight stakeholders",
      "explanation": "A. Security operations and oversight stakeholders will likely want to ingest vulnerability management data to perform data enrichment activities for other security systems. Audit and compliance, system administration, and management stakeholders are more likely to want written reports to review and use in their roles."

        "Alert volume",
        "Mean time to respond",
        "Mean time to remediate"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Alert volume",
      "explanation": "B. Simply knowing the volume of alerts for an organization is not a useful metric without context. It may indicate that the organization has a poorly tuned alerting system, that the system does not detect most events, or that there are other issues. Mean time to detect, mean time to respond, and mean time to remediate provide more useful information, although each requires context as well."

        "To achieve organizational governance targets",
        "To meet performance targets defined by the SLA"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "To meet performance targets defined by the SLA",
      "explanation": "D. Service level agreements (SLAs) often have performance targets like uptime included. Organizations that need to meet an SLA may delay patching to ensure they meet their overall uptime guarantees. SLAs and patching are not typically used to force vendor compliance or to ensure license compliance, nor are they likely to impact organizational governance targets."

        "A configuration management tool or system",
        "A baseline configuration scanner",
        "An endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A configuration management tool or system",
      "explanation": "B. Ian's desire to ensure patches across his infrastructure points to a need for a configuration management tool that can be used to deploy patches at scale. A vulnerability scanner doesn't install patches, baseline configuration scanners help determine whether the baseline is being met but won't help maintain the baseline, and EDR is used to detect malicious software and activity, not to patch or maintain a patch level."

      "correct_answer": "Regulatory compliance",
      "explanation": "C. Internal requirements are unlikely to require an incident report in a specific timeline, as they typically acknowledge the complexity of incident response. While the media may want a report in a specific timeframe, that does not require a response. Instead, of the listed items, regulatory compliance is the primary driver for reporting in a specific timeline for most organizations."

      "correct_answer": "Zero-day vulnerabilities won't show in previously run vulnerability management reports.",
      "explanation": "C. Chris knows that a zero-day vulnerability means that the scanner won't have had a rule or detection profile for the vulnerability. That means that previously run reports and scans won't show it. It's possible that their vendor may release a detection profile or rule for the zero-day, but with very little time from release to the request, that is unlikely to have occurred already. Rerunning reports won't show unknown vulnerabilities, and zero-day vulnerabilities can be detected if there's a rule."

      "answer": ["A read blocker", "A drive cloner", "A write blocker", "A hash validator"],
      "correct_answer": "A write blocker",
      "explanation": "C. Write blockers ensure that no changes are made to a source drive when creating a forensic copy. Preventing reads would stop you from copying the drive, drive cloners may or may not have write blocking capabilities built in, and hash validation is useful to ensure contents match but don't stop changes to the source drive from occurring."

      "question": "Frederick's organization has been informed that data must be preserved due to pending legal action. What is this type of requirement called?",
      "answer": ["A retainer", "A legal hold", "A data freeze", "An extra-legal hold"],
      "correct_answer": "A legal hold",
      "explanation": "B. A legal hold is a process used to preserve all data related to pending legal action or when legal action may be expected. A retainer is paid to a lawyer to keep them available for work. The other two terms were made up for this question."
    },
    {
      "question": "What process is often performed as part of incident response forensic analysis?",
      "answer": ["Blame assignment", "Root cause analysis", "Reverse hashing", "Legal holds"],
      "correct_answer": "Root cause analysis",
      "explanation": "B. A root cause analysis is often performed to identify what went wrong and why. Lessons learned are then identified and applied to ensure the organization doesn't experience the same issue in the future. Blame assignment is not a part of a forensic procedure and is typically discouraged in most organizations. Reverse hashing isn't possible, as hashes are one-way functions. Legal holds are associated with legal action, not incident response forensics."

      "question": "Jeff is investigating a system compromise and knows that the first event was reported on October 5. What forensic tool capability should he use to map other events found in logs and files to this date?",
      "answer": ["A timeline", "A log viewer", "Registry analysis", "Timestamp validator"],
      "correct_answer": "A timeline",
      "explanation": "A. Timelines are one of the most useful tools when conducting an investigation of a compromise or other event. Forensic tools provide built-in timeline capabilities to allow this type of analysis."

      "question": "During her forensic copy validation process, Danielle hashed the original, cloned the image files, and received the following MD5 sums. What is likely wrong?\nb49794e007e909c00a51ae208cacb169  original.img\nd9ff8a0cf6bc0ab066b6416e7e7abf35  clone.img",
      "answer": ["The original was modified.", "The clone was modified.", "dd failed.", "An unknown change or problem occurred."],
      "correct_answer": "An unknown change or problem occurred.",
      "explanation": "D. Since Danielle did not hash her source drive prior to cloning, you cannot determine where the problem occurred. If she had run MD5sum prior to the cloning process as well as after, she could verify that the original disk had not changed."

    {
      "question": "Jennifer wants to perform memory analysis and forensics for Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. Which of the following is best suited to her needs?",
      "answer": ["LiME", "DumpIt", "fmem", "The Volatility Framework"],
      "correct_answer": "The Volatility Framework",
      "explanation": "D. The Volatility Framework is designed to work with Windows, macOS, and Linux, and it provides in-depth memory forensics and analysis capabilities. LiME and fmem are Linux tools, whereas DumpIt is a Windows-only tool."

    {
      "question": "As part of her review of a forensic process, Lisa is reviewing a log that lists each time a person handled a forensic image. She notices that an entry lists forensic analysis actions but does not have a name logged. What concept does this violate?",
      "answer": ["Image integrity", "Forensic authenticity", "Preservation", "Chain of custody"],
      "correct_answer": "Chain of custody",
      "explanation": "D. Lisa has discovered an issue with chain of custody documentation. Each transfer, forensic action, or other change or event that occurs should be logged as part of a chain of custody."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is validating data integrity critical to forensic processes?",
      "answer": ["It ensures the system has not been compromised.", "It ensures the system has not been altered by the forensic examiner.", "It ensures the operating system version matches the expected version.", "It is required by the legal hold process."],
      "correct_answer": "It ensures the system has not been altered by the forensic examiner.",
      "explanation": "B. Validating data integrity ensures that images or files are forensically sound and have not been altered or modified either on purpose or accidentally during the forensic acquisition and analysis process. It does not ensure the system has not been compromised, and although artifacts can be assessed to validate file versions, typically they are not used to validate operating system versions. Finally, legal holds require data preservation, not data integrity validation."

      "question": "Carl does not have the ability to capture data from a cell phone using mobile forensic or imaging software, and the phone does not have removable storage. Fortunately, the phone was not set up with a PIN or screen lock. What is his best option to ensure he can see email and other data stored there?",
      "answer": ["Physical acquisition", "Logical access", "Filesystem access", "Manual access"],
      "correct_answer": "Manual access",
      "explanation": "D. Manual access is used when phones cannot be forensically imaged or accessed as a volume or filesystem. Manual access requires that the phone be reviewed by hand, with pictures and notes preserved to document the contents of the phone."

    {
      "question": "What forensic issue might the presence of a program like CCleaner indicate?",
      "answer": ["Antiforensic activities", "Full disk encryption", "Malware packing", "MAC time modifications"],
      "correct_answer": "Antiforensic activities",
      "explanation": "A. CCleaner is a PC cleanup utility that wipes Internet history, destroys cookies and other cached data, and can impede forensic investigations. CCleaner may be an indication of intentional antiforensic activities on a system. It is not a full-disk encryption tool or malware packer, nor will it modify MAC times."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following is not a potential issue with live imaging of a system?",
      "answer": ["Remnant data from the imaging tool will remain.", "Unallocated space will be captured.", "Memory or drive contents may change during the imaging process.", "Malware may detect the imaging tool and work to avoid it."],
      "correct_answer": "Unallocated space will be captured.",
      "explanation": "B. Unallocated space is typically not captured during a live image, potentially resulting in data being missed. Remnant data from the tool, memory and drive contents changing while the image is occurring, and malware detecting the tool are all possible issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "During his investigation, Jeff, a certified forensic examiner, is provided with a drive image created by an IT staff member and is asked to add it to his forensic case. What is the most important issue that Jeff could encounter if the case goes to court and his procedures are questioned?",
      "answer": ["Bad checksums", "Hash mismatch", "Antiforensic activities", "Inability to certify chain of custody"],
      "correct_answer": "Inability to certify chain of custody",
      "explanation": "D. Jeff did not create the image and cannot validate chain of custody for the drive. This also means he cannot prove that the drive is a copy of the original. Since we do not know the checksum for the original drive, we do not have a bad checksum or a hash mismatch—there isn't an original to compare it to. Antiforensic activities may have occurred, but we cannot determine that from the question."
    },
    {
      "question": "Jeff is investigating a system that is running malware that he believes encrypts its data on the drive. What process should he use to have the best chance of viewing that data in an unencrypted form?",
      "answer": ["Live imaging", "Offline imaging", "Brute-force encryption cracking", "Causing a system crash and analyzing the memory dump"],
      "correct_answer": "Offline imaging",
      "explanation": "A. Imaging the system while the program is live has the best probability of allowing Jeff to capture the encryption keys or decrypted data from memory. An offline image after the system is shut down will likely result in having to deal with the encrypted file. Brute-force attacks are typically slow and may not succeed, and causing a system crash may result in corrupted or nonexistent data."

    {
      "question": "Susan needs to capture network traffic from a Linux server that does not use a GUI. What packet capture utility is found on many Linux systems and works from the command line?",
      "answer": ["tcpdump", "netdd", "Wireshark", "Snifman"],
      "correct_answer": "tcpdump",
      "explanation": "A. The tcpdump utility is a command-line packet capture tool that is found on many Linux systems. Wireshark is a GUI tool available for most operating systems. Netdd and Snifman were made up for this question."

      "question": "During a forensic investigation, Ben asks Chris to sit with him and to sign off on the actions he has taken. What is he doing?",
      "answer": ["Maintaining chain of custody", "Over-the-shoulder validation", "Pair forensics", "Separation of duties"],
      "correct_answer": "Over-the-shoulder validation",
      "explanation": "A. Ben is maintaining chain of custody documentation. Chris is acting as the validator for the actions that Ben takes and acts as a witness to the process."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which tool is not commonly used to generate the hash of a forensic copy?",
      "answer": ["MD5", "FTK", "SHA1", "AES"],
      "correct_answer": "AES",
      "explanation": "D. While AES does have a hashing mode, MD5, SHA1, and built-in hashing tools in FTK and other commercial tools are more commonly used for forensic hashes."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following issues makes both cloud and virtualized environments more difficult to perform forensics on?",
      "answer": ["Other organizations manage them.", "Systems may be ephemeral.", "No forensic tools work in both environments.", "Drive images cannot be verified."],
      "correct_answer": "Systems may be ephemeral.",
      "explanation": "B. Both cloud and virtualized environments are often temporary (ephemeral) and thus can be difficult to perform forensics on. If you have a cloud, virtualized, or containerized environment, make sure you have considered how you would perform forensics, and what data preservation techniques you may need to use."
